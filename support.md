## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**  
No. Expensley works without any account or login. Just download and start tracking.

**Q: How do I add an expense?**  
Tap the input field and type naturally, like "coffee 5" or "uber 15". The AI will automatically categorize it for you.

**Q: Can I use the app offline?**  
Yes, for basic expense tracking. However, AI features (natural language parsing, receipt scanning, insights) require an internet connection.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
All your financial data (transactions, budgets, goals) is stored locally on your device. We never upload your transaction history to our servers.

**Q: What data is sent to the cloud?**  
Only when you use AI features:
- **Natural language input:** The text you type is sent for parsing
- **Receipt scanning:** The image is sent for text extraction
- **Currency conversion:** Currency codes only (not amounts)

Your financial records themselves are never transmitted.

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
Currently, data export is not available. We're considering this for a future update.

**Q: What happens if I delete the app?**  
All your data is permanently deleted. There is no cloud backup.

### Features

**Q: How does receipt scanning work?**  
Point your camera at a receipt, and the app uses OCR (optical character recognition) to extract the merchant name, amount, and date automatically.

**Q: What currencies are supported?**  
USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, NZD, CHF, and AED. You can change your currency in Settings.

**Q: Can I change my currency after setting it up?**  
Yes, go to Settings and select a new currency. Note: You can only change currency once per day, and historical transactions are displayed using a conversion rate (they're not individually converted).

**Q: How do recurring transactions work?**  
When adding an expense or income, toggle "Recurring" and set the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly). The transaction will be added automatically on schedule.

**Q: What are budgets?**  
Budgets let you set spending limits for categories like Food, Transportation, or Housing. The app tracks your spending against these limits.

**Q: What are savings goals?**  
Savings goals let you set targets (like "Vacation $2000") and allocate money toward them. You can track progress and see how close you are to reaching each goal.

### Subscriptions

**Q: Is Expensley free?**  
Yes, the core expense tracking features are free. Premium subscriptions unlock additional features like AI insights, unlimited budgets, and more.

**Q: How do I manage or cancel my subscription?**  
Go to Settings > Manage Subscription, or open the App Store > tap your profile > Subscriptions > Expensley.

**Q: I subscribed but features aren't unlocking.**  
Try these steps:
1. Make sure you're connected to the internet
2. Go to Settings > Restore Purchases
3. Wait a few moments for Apple's servers to sync
4. If still not working, restart the app

**Q: Can I get a refund?**  
Refunds are handled by Apple. Visit [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com) to request a refund.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app is running slowly.**  
Try closing and reopening the app. If the issue persists, restart your device.

**Q: AI features aren't working / "Service unavailable" error.**  
This usually means:
- You're offline — check your internet connection
- Our servers are temporarily busy — wait a moment and try again
- You've reached your monthly usage limit — upgrade or wait for the next month

**Q: Receipt scanning isn't recognizing my receipt.**  
For best results:
- Ensure good lighting
- Hold the camera steady
- Make sure the entire receipt is visible
- Avoid crumpled or faded receipts

**Q: My transactions disappeared.**  
Transactions are stored locally on your device. If they disappeared:
- Did you recently delete and reinstall the app?
- Did you restore your device from a backup?

Unfortunately, without cloud backup, deleted data cannot be recovered.

**Q: The app crashed.**  
Please email us with details about what you were doing when it crashed. Include your iOS version and device model.
