## 1) Introduction & Acceptance of Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Expensley mobile application ("App") and related services (together, the "Services") provided by Mohamad Shybly ("we", "us", "our", or "Provider").

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using Expensley, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

- **User Content:** Data you enter or create in the App (e.g., transactions, budgets, goals), and content you provide for processing (e.g., receipt images you scan).
- **AI Features:** Cloud processing used to parse text, categorize transactions, extract structured data from OCR text, and generate insights.
- **AI Credits:** Monthly usage allowance for AI Features based on your plan.
- **Subscription:** Auto-renewable in-app purchase offered via Apple App Store (Plus, Pro).

## 3) Eligibility (All Ages; Parental Responsibility)

Expensley is available to users of all ages and is not specifically directed at children.

- If you are a minor, your parent/guardian is responsible for your use of the App and for supervising any data you enter or scan.
- We do not require accounts and do not request children to provide personal information.
- If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided personal information in scanned documents or typed text, you can help them stop further processing by disabling AI Features (where available) and/or uninstalling the App, which deletes local data.

## 4) Account Terms (No Account Required)

Expensley does not require account creation or login. We do not link usage to your Apple ID ourselves. Purchases and subscription management are handled by Apple.

## 5) User Responsibilities

You agree to:

- Not misuse the Services, including attempting to:
  - circumvent rate limits, AI credit limits, or security protections;
  - interfere with or disrupt the Services;
  - reverse engineer or tamper with the App except as permitted by applicable law.

You control what you enter and scan. Receipts or documents may contain sensitive information (e.g., names, addresses, card fragments). Consider redacting before scanning if you prefer.

## 8) Intellectual Property

The App, Services, designs, trademarks (including "Expensley"), and all related intellectual property are owned by the Provider or licensors and are protected by applicable laws.

We grant you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms and Apple's applicable rules.

## 9) User Content & Ownership

- **You own your User Content.** We do not claim ownership of your financial data.
- **Local-first storage:** Transactions, budgets, savings goals, and preferences are stored locally on your device (e.g., via Apple Core Data) and protected by device security (passcode/Face ID/Touch ID). We cannot access, read, or recover this local data.
- **Uninstall deletes local data:** Removing the App typically deletes its locally stored data from your device.

## 10) Third-Party Services

Expensley uses third-party services for specific features:

- **Anthropic (Claude AI):** natural-language parsing and structured extraction from OCR text
- **Google Document AI:** OCR extraction from scanned images
- **Open Exchange Rates API (or similar):** currency conversion rates using currency codes
- **Apple StoreKit 2:** subscriptions (handled by Apple)
- **Apple App Attest:** device verification (cryptographic attestation)

Third-party terms and privacy policies apply when you use those features:

- Anthropic: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy
- Google Cloud: https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice
- Apple: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

**No guarantee of third-party availability:** Third-party services may change, suspend, or discontinue. We are not responsible for third-party outages or changes.

## 11) Privacy & Data Handling (Summary; See Privacy Policy)

Our Privacy Policy explains how Expensley handles data: https://mhdsysy.github.io/privacy

### Data Processing Overview (high level)

- **On-device (not transmitted):** transactions, budgets, goals, preferences.
- **Temporary cloud processing (not stored by us):**
  - Typed text for transaction parsing (text only)
  - Receipt images for OCR (processed for extraction)
  - OCR text sent for structuring (text only)
  - Currency conversion uses currency codes only
- **Device identifier:** A randomly generated local UUID may be used for rate limiting; not linked to your Apple ID.
- **App Attest:** Used to verify legitimate app installations via Apple's cryptographic attestation.

Where required by law, you may have rights to access, delete, correct, object, or receive a copy of personal data. Because core data is stored locally and not accessible to us, many rights can be exercised directly in-app or by uninstalling.

## 12) Disclaimers

### Not Financial Advice

Expensley provides tools and informational insights only. We are not a bank, broker, financial advisor, or accountant, and nothing in the App is financial, tax, legal, or investment advice.

### AI May Produce Errors

AI features may misinterpret text, mis-categorize transactions, or produce incomplete/incorrect insights. You are responsible for reviewing outputs before relying on them.

### Exchange Rates Are Informational

Exchange rates may be delayed, approximate, or unavailable. Do not rely on rates for time-sensitive or high-value decisions without verification.

### "As Is" / "As Available"

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

**Consumer law note:** Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers. In those cases, disclaimers apply only to the extent legally permitted.

## 13) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- **No indirect damages:** We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill.
- **Cap on liability:** Our total liability for any claim related to the Services will not exceed the subscription fees you paid to Apple for Expensley in the 12 months immediately before the event giving rise to the claim (or, if you have never paid, EUR 0).
- **Essential exclusions:** Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for:
  - intent or willful misconduct (and where applicable, gross negligence);
  - death or personal injury caused by negligence;
  - fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;
  - liability that cannot be limited under mandatory consumer laws.

**Jurisdiction-specific consumer protections:** If you are a consumer in the EU/UK/Australia/New Zealand/Canada/Switzerland/UAE (or elsewhere), mandatory statutory rights and remedies may apply and cannot be excluded.

## 14) Indemnification

To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of your misuse of the Services, violation of these Terms, or violation of any law or third-party rights.

**Consumer law note:** This indemnity does not apply where prohibited by consumer protection laws.

## 15) Termination & Discontinuation

- You may stop using Expensley at any time.
- You may cancel subscriptions through Apple (see Section 7).
- We may suspend or discontinue the Services (including AI Features) at any time, for example to maintain security, comply with law, or retire features.
- If we discontinue paid features, we will take reasonable steps to avoid unfair impact on consumers and to comply with applicable law.

## 16) Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

### Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Germany.

### Courts / Jurisdiction

If you are a business user, or where legally permitted for consumers, disputes shall be subject to the courts of Berlin, Germany.

### EU/UK Consumer Rights

If you are a consumer residing in the EU/EEA or the UK, you may benefit from mandatory consumer protections and may be able to bring claims in your home jurisdiction where required by law.

### EU Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)

The European Commission provides an online dispute resolution platform: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr

### Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Notice

We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.

## 17) EU/UK Right of Withdrawal (Cooling-Off / Widerrufsrecht)

If you are an EU/EEA or UK consumer, you generally have a 14-day right to withdraw from distance contracts (cooling-off period), including for digital services.

**Important exception (digital services):** Your right to withdraw may be lost if you request immediate performance (immediate access to subscription features) and acknowledge that you lose the right of withdrawal once performance begins.

Because Expensley subscriptions typically provide immediate access to digital features, by completing your purchase and starting to use subscription features, you may be treated as requesting immediate performance and acknowledging loss of the withdrawal right, where applicable.

Apple may also provide purchase flows and notices reflecting these consumer rights.

## 18) Australia & New Zealand Consumer Guarantees

- If you are in Australia, nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies consumer guarantees or rights under the Australian Consumer Law. You may be entitled to remedies for major failures and compensation for reasonably foreseeable loss.
- If you are in New Zealand, you may have rights under the Consumer Guarantees Act and other applicable laws. Those statutory rights are not excluded by these Terms.

## 19) United States Notices (Including California & Children's Privacy)

### General

US consumers may have rights under federal and state consumer protection laws. These Terms do not limit non-waivable rights.

### California (CCPA)

Expensley is designed to operate without collecting personal information like name, email, address, location, advertising identifiers, or analytics identifiers. Where "personal information" is processed (e.g., content you choose to type or scan), it is used only to provide requested functionality (such as parsing or OCR), as described in the Privacy Policy.

### Children (COPPA)

Expensley is not directed to children under 13 and does not require accounts. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Parents/guardians are responsible for supervising minors' use, especially when scanning documents that could contain personal information.

## 20) Canada Notices

Canadian consumers may have rights under federal and provincial consumer protection laws and privacy laws. These Terms do not waive non-excludable statutory rights.

We aim to describe pricing and subscription terms clearly and avoid misleading representations.

## 21) Switzerland Notices

Swiss users may have rights under Swiss consumer and data protection laws, including the revised Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (revDSG / nFADP). These Terms do not exclude liability or rights where exclusion is not permitted by Swiss mandatory law.

## 22) United Arab Emirates (UAE) Notices

UAE consumers may have rights under applicable UAE consumer protection and data protection laws. These Terms do not exclude mandatory rights under UAE law.

## 23) Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms to reflect changes to the App, Services, law, or operational needs. If we make material changes, we will update the Last Updated date. Continued use of Expensley after an update means you accept the updated Terms.

## 24) Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

## 25) Entire Agreement

These Terms (together with the Privacy Policy and any in-app disclosures) form the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services.
